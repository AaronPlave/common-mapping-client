## Welcome to the Common Mapping Client 2.0!

#### Overview

The Common Mapping Client (CMC) aims to solve the problem of redundant and unshared
code in scientific web mapping applicaitons.

Over the years, there have been many projects that try to solve the same issue:
put data on a map and explore it. There is an increasingly steep hill to climb
when it comes to deciding: Which framework should I start from? Which library
will give me all the features I need? How to I glue all these together with 
a code layout that I won't want to burn next week? CMC solves this by bundling
together a solid and modular base framework with an extensive mapping library,
a well thought out component structure, and a thick shield against feature-creep
to deliver you what is essentially a starter project for mapping that will let
you start building the cool sh** faster.

We maintain a list of further example projects and projects that began from CMC
so that you can easily get examples of building intricate and detailed workflows
on top of our client.
