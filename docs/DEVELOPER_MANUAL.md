# Developer Manual

### Installation guide
Make sure you have `Node` and `npm` installed before continuing.

Once you have a copy of the project, install all the dependencies and prep the project for development by running:

* `npm install`

Next, start the development server by running:

* `npm start`

Your default browser should open to localhost:3000 and you should see a default mapping application.

Now get building!
