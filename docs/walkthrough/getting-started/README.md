# Getting Started

Now that we have the default CMC application up and running we can start transforming it into our desired application. For this walkthrough we will be creating a simple application that presents some layers and interactions for exploring Hurricane Maria in September of 2017.

TODO Add table of contents once done.

JUST THINGS TO REMEMBER TO INCLUDE

* Adding an Interactive Vector Layer
* Adding a Fly-To-Layer Feature
* Changing Help Text
* Adding different basemaps
