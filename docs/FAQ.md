### Quick Installation
* `npm3 install`
* `npm start`

### Where did this project start?
CMC was born in 2014 and used Dojo as its underlying framework. After much
fragmentation and slapdash development, a new effort was undertaken in 2016
to create a stable and forward-thinking re-implementation of CMC using
React/Redux. This project used [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)
as a starting point. See it's documentation for more info.

### How do I build for production?
* `npm run build`
