/*
This is the main component container for your
application. It will instantiate all the major
sub-components of the application and perform
any startup operations required.

Create your own:
1. Copy the contents of `src/_core/components/App/AppContainer.js` here
2. Modify as needed with your custom components
3. Modify `src/index.js` to use this AppContainer instead of the _core version
